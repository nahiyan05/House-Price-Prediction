# House-Price-Prediction
 This project is about predicting house prices and categorizing them into
 three groups: Low, Mid, and High. Using machine learning, we aim to create a system
 that helps estimate house prices based on different features of a property such as number
 of bedrooms/bathrooms, stories, and amenities like air conditioning and parking etc. for
 buyers and sellers to make informed decisions.
 In the real estate market, determining property values can be tricky because many factors
 come into play, like location, size, and amenities. This uncertainty often leads to
 confusion, missed opportunities, or financial mistakes for buyers, sellers, and agents. A
 reliable model that predicts house prices can simplify the process, helping everyone make
 smarter decisions while saving time and effort.
 Motivation
 ● Helpbuyers find properties within their budget .
 ● Enable sellers to price homes competitively Provide real estate agents with
 data-backed pricing recommendations.
 ● Makeproperty valuation more transparent and accessible

  This is a Classification Problem . We are not predicting an average or the exact values of
 prices . We have binned continuous price values and categorized prices into predefined groups
 ‘'Low', 'Mid', 'High' . The model predicts the likelihood of a house falling into one of the defined
 categories.
